# vdcrpt Experimental

This is an experimental branch of vdcrpt, rewritten in C#. Nothing is
guaranteed to come of it, but it may serve as the basis for a more powerful
tool.

## Subprojects

Vdcrpt.Avi is a binary AVI manipulation library modeled after
[ucnv/aviglitch].

Vdcrpt.UI is the actual GUI application.
