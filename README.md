# vdcrpt

Corrupt videos in weird and interesting ways.

## Rewrite Branch

This branch is a rewrite of vdcrpt in C#. I am doing this mostly for personal reasons:

- The codebase is small and still easy to migrate
- Almost all of my work is done in C# now
- I like Python, but am more comfortable with C#/.NET tooling than PySide2/PyInstaller/etc.
