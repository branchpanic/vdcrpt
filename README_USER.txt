vdcrpt
======

Thanks for downloading version 0.1.0 of vdcrpt. This is an unstable alpha
release.

After starting the program, a text window should show up. Wait a few
minutes for vdcrpt to extract all of its dependencies. The main UI will
show up shortly after. Don't close the terminal window, because vdcrpt will
close along with it. This window may also show some useful debugging
information in the event of a crash or failure.
